==============
RACHEL http://rachel.worldpossible.org/about.html enables people to learn various topics. It includes lots of materials from various sources and is distributed free-of-charge. Our aim is to help make the RACHEL project easier to: commission, update, operate and maintain the RACHEL project on Debian-like computers, including Raspberry Pi's. We aim to do so by creating various programatic scripts in software which will be available online, including here.

Where practical we prefer to contribute scripts, etc. to the upstream projects, such as ka-lite https://github.com/learningequality/ka-lite/wiki and kiwix http://kiwix.org/wiki/Main_Page
